      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>WebsiteChef is a tight-knit group of experienced designers and developers with a passion for creating custom websites. For years now, we see people spending a lot of money on websites that aren’t even custom made. Just some template that is
        being (minimally) customized as if it were their own. We want you to know we don’t take part in this. We think everyone should have the opportunity to have a custom website, built by professionals, at an affordable price.</p>
